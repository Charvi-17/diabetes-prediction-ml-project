# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning model that predicts whether a person has diabetes using the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset**.  
It includes data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and accuracy measurement.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This ML project helps identify potential diabetes risk based on input medical parameters such as:
- Pregnancies  
- Glucose level  
- Blood Pressure  
- Skin Thickness  
- Insulin  
- BMI  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function  
- Age  

The goal is to build a model that predicts diabetes using **Logistic Regression**.
